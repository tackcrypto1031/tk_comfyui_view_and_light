## 🚀 Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Widget**: A real-time 3D viewport using Three.js to visualize camera and light positions.
- **Precision Camera Control**: Adjust horizontal angle (0-360°), vertical angle (-90 to 90°), and zoom levels.
- **Dynamic Lighting Control**: Enable/Disable lighting, adjust light source direction, and choose light colors with a built-in color picker.
- **Dual Prompt Output**: Automatically generates two separate prompts:
  - `camera_prompt`: Detailed camera positioning (e.g., "front-right quarter view, eye-level shot, medium shot").
  - `light_prompt`: Detailed lighting description (e.g., "(light source from the Right Front, High), #FFFFFF colored light").
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time updates of the 3D scene based on your inputs.
